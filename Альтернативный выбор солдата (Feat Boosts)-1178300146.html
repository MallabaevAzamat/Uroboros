<p>Необходимая черта – условие для взятия этой feat boost. Причём брать
нужно заранее, не на этом же уровне!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Coordination (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coordinated Shot</p>
<p>When you are threatening a foe with a wielded melee weapon, cover it
gains from you doesn’t grant it any bonus to AC against your allies’
ranged attacks. The foe still counts as having cover for the purpose of
effects such as the Coordinated Shot feat; it simply doesn’t gain any
cover bonuses to AC against your allies’ attacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beatdown (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved Combat Maneuver [Trip]</p>
<p>Whenever a prone opponent that you threaten attempts to stand up from
prone, as a reaction you can make a melee attack against that opponent.
This functions similarly to an attack of opportunity, except your attack
resolves before the opponent’s action (meaning they’re still prone when
your attack roll and damage are resolved). You cannot use this attack to
make a combat maneuver, even if you have another ability or item that
would normally allow you to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bodyguard Vigilance (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bodyguard</p>
<p>When you use the Bodyguard feat, it requires no action, but you must
spend 1 Resolve Point each time after the first you use the Bodyguard
feat during a single round, and each use must designate a different
ally. Multiple uses of the Bodyguard feat don’t increase the penalty to
Armor Class that you take using this feat. If you also have In Harm’s
Way, each round you can use that feat to intercept one attack per target
whose AC you have increased with the Bodyguard feat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chokehold (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple]</p>
<p>Whenever you have an opponent pinned, that foe can’t speak or perform
actions that involve speaking or uttering sound using their voice (such
as roaring, singing, and so on). Normally this prevents the target from
using language-dependent abilities unless they have limited telepathy or
a similar ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defensive Cleave (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleave</p>
<p>When you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you don’t take that
feat’s penalty to your Armor Class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defensive Lunge (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lunge</p>
<p>When you use the Lunge feat, you don’t take that feat’s penalty to
your Armor Class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grabbing Strike (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple]</p>
<p>Whenever you attack an opponent with an unarmed strike and the result
of your attack roll exceeds the foe’s KAC by 8 or more, that foe gains
the grappled condition as if you had successfully attempted a grapple
combat maneuver. You must be at least 11th level to select this feat
boost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grapple Equipment (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple]</p>
<p>Whenever you succeed at an attack roll to grapple an opponent, you
can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed,
as described by the grapple combat maneuver, instead of imposing the
grappled condition on your foe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lightning Kip-Up (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kip-Up</p>
<p>Whenever you have at least 1 Resolve Point, you can stand from prone
as part of any other action you take. Creatures with the moxie racial
trait can select this feat boost even if they do not have the Kip Up
feat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-Weapon Strike (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multi-Weapon Fighting</p>
<p>As a standard action, you can make two attacks against a single foe,
taking a –3 penalty to each attack. Both attacks must be made using
small arms or operative melee weapons. If both attacks hit and deal the
same type of damage, combine the damage and apply damage reduction,
resistances, vulnerabilities, and similar effects only once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-Weapon Versatility (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multi-Weapon Fighting</p>
<p>You treat all one-handed melee weapons as if they had the operative
special property for the purpose of determining whether they benefit
from the Multi-Weapon Fighting feat and any other combat feats and feat
boosts that list Multi-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sliding Disarm (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improved Combat Maneuver [Disarm]</p>
<p>Whenever you successfully use the disarm combat maneuver against an
opponent, you can knock the disarmed item up to 10 feet away from the
opponent in a direction of your choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soldier’s Adaptability (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adaptive Fighting</p>
<p>You can use the Adaptive Fighting feat multiple times per day. Each
time per day you use Adaptive Fighting after the first, you must spend 1
Resolve Point. If you use Adaptive Fighting again before a previous use
expires, you replace the previously chosen feat with a different choice.
If a combat feat has any daily, encounter, or target limitations, any
uses of any feat chosen with this ability count toward its daily
limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spinning Cleave (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleave</p>
<p>Whenever you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can make
subsequent attacks against foes that are not adjacent to one another,
provided each foe is within your reach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Springing Onslaught (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spring Attack</p>
<p>When you use Spring Attack, you can select two targets to attack
during your movement instead of one. Both attacks are made with a –4
penalty. All restrictions of Spring Attack apply to both targets, and
your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either
target. You can’t target the same creature twice with this ability. You
must be at least 7th level to select this feat boost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Springing Shot (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shot on the Run</p>
<p>When you use Shot on the Run, you can select two targets to attack
during your movement instead of one. Both attacks take a –4 penalty. All
restrictions of Shot on the Run apply to both targets, and your movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You can’t
target the same creature twice with this ability. You must be at least
7th level to select this feat boost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volleying Bombardment (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opening Volley</p>
<p>Whenever you deal damage to an opponent with a ranged attack on your
second or subsequent turn in a combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to your next melee attack against that opponent, so long as this melee
attack occurs before the end of your next turn.</p>
