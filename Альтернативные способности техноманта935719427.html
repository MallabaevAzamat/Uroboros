<p><strong>Cache Augmentation (Ex)</strong></p>
<p>Your studies of the fundamental forces of the galaxy have enabled you
to enhance one of your body’s systems to benefit from the energy of
stored spells. You might have been bestowed this augmentation by an
order of technomancers, implanted the augmentation into yourself as part
of your research, or witnessed part of your body undergo a technomantic
apotheosis that left you with the ability to cast spells. Your cache
augmentation takes the form of any cybernetic augmentation or magitech
augmentation (Starfinder Armory 90) of your choice with an item level of
1. Each time you gain a level, the item level of your augmentation
increases by 1, and you can replace it with a different augmentation
with an item level equal to your technomancer level or lower. This
augmentation counts toward the total number of augmentations you can
have implanted into each of your body’s systems as normal.</p>
<p>At 6th level, each time you regain your spells, choose one of the
following: attack rolls, Computers and Engineering checks, Fortitude
saves, or Reflex saves. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of your
chosen type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 12th level and +3
at 18th level.</p>
<p>At 12th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a second
option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls
of this type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 18th level.</p>
<p>At 18th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a third
option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls
of this type.</p>
<p>These enhancement bonuses count as part of the effects of your cache
augmentation, and if your augmentation is removed or its effects
suppressed (such as by the reject augmentation spell) you also lose
these bonuses.</p>
<p>This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>Cache Hacks (Su)</strong></p>
<p>At 6th level, you can acquire a cache hack, a fundamental shift in
the focus of your spell cache that alters the spells you can cast with
the cache capacitor class feature. Choose one of the cache hacks
described below; your cache capacitor can hold the listed spells instead
of those described on page 120 of the Core Rulebook.</p>
<p>Some of the cache hacks described below allow you to place spells
with targets into your cache capacitor. These spells are marked with an
asterisk (*). For such spells, you effectively gain the ability to cast
the cached spell at will. You don't need to make any decisions required
for the spell in advance, but their duration expires normally.
Reestablishing one of these spells requires only that you cast the spell
again; you don't need to spend 5 minutes reestablishing it. You can have
only one instance of each spell active at a time, and casting the spell
again causes the previous instance to automatically end, as if its
duration had expired. After 24 hours, you lose the ability to cast the
spell in your cache capacitor and effects produced by those spells
immediately end, as if their duration had expired.</p>
<p>Aside from the change in the spell list and the changes listed above,
your cache capacitor otherwise functions as described in the cache
capacitor class feature. This alters cache capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>Drone Technomancy</strong></p>
<p>You have created an extraordinary new life powered by your
technomancy, providing you a skilled companion at the cost of your
overall magical potential. You gain a drone artificial intelligence,
using your technomancer level as your mechanic level. If you have
additional levels in a class that provides you a drone artificial
intelligence, you add them together to the determine the effectiveness
of your drone. You gain one fewer spell slot per day of each level.</p>
<p>When you learn new magic hacks, you can choose to select any of the
following mechanic tricks as though they were magic hacks, using your
technomancer level as your mechanic level to qualify for these tricks:
drone meld, extra drone mod, hyperclocking, mod tinkerer, overclocking,
repair drone, and ultraclocking.</p>
<p>This alters spells and replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>Hack Capacitor (Su)</strong></p>
<p>You can adjust your magical knowledge, granting you the ability to
hack your spellcasting in unexpected ways. Select three magic hacks that
you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. As a move action, you
can gain the benefit of one of these magic hacks for 1 minute. You can
use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after
the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use
hack capacitor again before the duration expires, you replace the
previous magic hack with the new choice. If a magic hack you chose with
hack capacitor has a daily use limitation, any uses of any magic hack
from your hack capacitor count toward the hack’s daily limit. Each time
you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one magic hack you
selected with this ability with another choice.</p>
<p>At 12th level, select a fourth magic hack. As a move action, you can
gain the benefit of two magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 1 Resolve
Point (or 2 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during
the same day). Both magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose
of this ability, so if you use this ability again during the same day,
both magic hacks are replaced.</p>
<p>At 18th level, select a fifth magic hack. As a move action, you can
gain the benefit of three magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 2 Resolve
Points (or 3 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during
the same day). All three magic hacks count as a single choice for the
purpose of this ability. At 19th level, you can use this ability as a
swift action or a move action.</p>
<p>This replaces cache capacitor and resolve attunement.</p>
<p><strong>Immortal Tutor (Su)</strong></p>
<p>You’ve learned technology from extraplanar experts. Choose one of the
following categories that best fits your immortal tutor: aeon,
celestial, elemental, fiend, inevitable, or protean. You gain the
benefits associated with that tutor.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to cast a specific variable‑level
spell once per day without expending a spell slot as though it were one
of your known technomancer spells, and you do so using the spell level
equal to the highest-level technomancer spell you can cast.</p>
<p>At 6th level, when you cast a 1st-level or higher technomancer spell,
you can gain the tutor’s first lesson for a number of rounds equal to
your Intelligence modifier. After you do so, you can’t use the first
lesson again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.
At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to gain the
benefits of your patron’s second lesson. At 18th level, you learn your
patron’s third lesson, which grants an additional benefit whenever the
first lesson ability is active.</p>
<p>This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>Junk Technomancy</strong></p>
<p>Your magic easily recycles technological refuse into useful tools,
literally making another’s trash into your treasure. You gain junk armor
and junksword as 1st-level spells known. When you gain the ability to
cast technomancer spells of a higher level, you add the next higher
level of junk armor and junksword to your list of spells known. You
immediately lose the lower level version of these two spells and replace
them with one spell known for that lower spell level. Once per day, you
can cast junk armor or junksword as a spell of the highest technomancer
spell level that you can cast without expending a spell slot. When you
cast junk spells—including any spells that specifically create or
manipulate junk, such as junk armor, handy junkbot, or other spells as
the GM’s discretion—you treat your technomancer caster level as 1 higher
than normal.</p>
<p>At 3rd level, your techlore class feature grants its insight bonus to
your Engineering checks rather than to Computers checks; it still grants
you an insight bonus to Mysticism checks. At 6th level, armor you create
or enhance with junk armor gains one armor upgrade slot. When you create
a junksword, you can simultaneously place a weapon fusion seal into it
whose item level cannot exceed half the spell’s caster level; the fusion
seal is harmlessly returned to your hand when the spell ends.</p>
<p>This alters spells and techlore, and it replaces spell cache and
cache capacitor.</p>
