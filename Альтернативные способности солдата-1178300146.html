<p><strong>Ascetic Warrior</strong></p>
<p>You study fighting styles thought lost to the Gap, often recorded
only in the art of ancient civilizations or inferred from the shape of
relic weapons and battle gear. You focus specifically ancient motions
and techniques that rely on form and mobility rather than the harshness
of attacks and resilience. You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus
feat. You can deal lethal damage with your unarmed strikes, and the
attack doesn’t count as archaic. At 3rd level, you gain a unique Weapon
Specialization with your unarmed strikes, allowing you to add 1-1/2
times your character level to your damage rolls for your unarmed strikes
(instead of just adding your character level, as usual). If you can
already add 1-1/2 your character level to your unarmed attack rolls
(such as due to the vesk natural attack racial trait), you instead can
add the block, grapple, and stun weapon special properties to your
unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>This replaces the soldier’s proficiency with heavy armor and heavy
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Feat Boosts</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a
technique called a feat boost that makes you better at using a specific
combat feat that you have. All feat boosts require that you have a
specific combat feat; this combat feat is indicated in parentheses after
the feat boost's name. You cannot select a feat boost at the same level
you gain access to its related feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special Ops Trainings</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a
technique called special ops training that makes you better with one or
more skills commonly used to perform special military operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Operations Specialist (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose one class skill you gained from the soldier class or a soldier
class feature. You gain an insight bonus to this skill equal to
one-third your soldier class level (minimum +1). You can select this
special ops training more than once. Each time, you select a different
class skill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operations Specialist (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Disguise,
Perception, Piloting, or Stealth. Add the chosen skill to your list of
soldier class skills, and gain a +1 bonus to checks with this skill. You
can select this special ops training more than once. Each time, you
select a different class skill.</p>
