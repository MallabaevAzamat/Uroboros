<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimental Apparatus (Su)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have created an experimental apparatus, a unique item that blends
technology and magic. Your experimental apparatus is a hybrid item that
must be held in one hand to impart any benefit. Incorporated into the
apparatus is one nonconsumable hybrid or magic item with an item level
of 1 and no more than 1 bulk. The apparatus has light bulk, but it
becomes 1 bulk if it has an incorporated item that has 1 bulk. While you
wield the apparatus, you gain the benefits of the incorporated hybrid or
magic item, even if you are already wearing your maximum number of
hybrid or magic items. Due to its esoteric design and controls, you are
the only one who can gain any benefit from the apparatus.</p>
<p>You can incorporate additional items into the apparatus to expand its
functions, including hybrid items, magic items, and magitech
augmentations (for the arm, brain, endocrine, hand, or throat systems).
An incorporated item’s item level cannot exceed your mechanic level, its
bulk cannot be greater than 1, and the apparatus can accommodate a total
of only two incorporated items (including the apparatus’s starting
item). Incorporating an item into the apparatus takes 8 hours of work
and functionally destroys that item in the process. Each item has its
own set of charges, if any. You only gain the benefits of a single
incorporated item at a time, though you can switch which item is active
as a standard action, or as a move action if you spend 1 Resolve
Point.</p>
<p>If your apparatus is destroyed or lost, you retain its schematics in
your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for free after 24 hours
of uninterrupted work. You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24
hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of
conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to
rebuild your apparatus. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic
level, you can rebuild your apparatus with the same amount of work,
allowing you to replace one of the installed items at no cost, selecting
an item with an item level no higher than the item level of the item
being replaced.</p>
<p><strong>1 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mystical Technician (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add Mysticism to your list of class skills in place of Computers.
Additionally, you can add your Intelligence modifier instead of your
Wisdom modifier to Mysticism checks. The insight bonus granted by your
Bypass mechanic class feature applies to Engineering and Mysticism
checks, not to Computers checks.</p>
<p><strong>5 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Artifice (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your experimental apparatus can now accommodate up to three
incorporated items. Upon gaining this ability, you can incorporate the
functions of one item whose item level is 3 or less into your
experimental apparatus at no cost.</p>
<p><strong>7 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enhanced Interface (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can change your experimental apparatus’s active devices as a move
action, or as a swift action by spending 1 Resolve Point.</p>
<p><strong>10 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technological Arcana (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By drawing on your apparatus’s energy reserves through embedded spell
gems, you can replicate a limited number of magical effects. Choose two
0-level technomancer spells, two 1st-level technomancer spells, and one
2nd-level technomancer spell. You incorporate spell gems for these
spells into your apparatus at no cost. You gain a limited version of the
technomancer’s spells class feature, though you can use these spells
only while wielding the apparatus, and your selection of spells is
limited to those spells embedded in the apparatus. You have one
1st-level spell slot and one 2nd-level spell slot, and you can cast the
0-level spells at will. You gain one 3rd-level spell slot at 13th level,
and you gain one 4th-level spell slot at 16th level. Casting these
spells does not expend the incorporated spell gems. Your experimental
apparatus can store a maximum number of spell gems equal to half your
mechanic level, and these spell gems can be of any level. You can
incorporate and replace spell gems in the apparatus as you would new
magic items, and incorporated spell gems are effectively destroyed once
installed.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever you would gain a new mechanic trick, you can
instead increase the number of spell gems the apparatus can hold by one,
as well as gain one additional spell slot of your maximum spellcasting
level, to a maximum of four spells per level.</p>
<p><strong>15 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versatile Apparatus (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your experimental apparatus can now accommodate up to four
incorporated items. The apparatus grants the abilities of two
incorporated items at a time.</p>
<p><strong>20 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unparalleled Apparatus (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your apparatus is so technologically sophisticated that it is almost
a magical artifact. Choose one of the following benefits.</p>
<p>Enduring Legacy: You have perfected the apparatus’s function and
durability, allowing others to use it for ages to come. The apparatus’s
item level is treated as 30 for the purpose of its hardness, Hit Points,
and saving throws. If a creature spends 1 Resolve Point, they can
operate the apparatus as though they were you for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Magitech Marvel: You gain one 5th-level spell slot that you can use
with the technological arcana ability, and you increase your number of
3rd- and 4th-level spell slots for that ability by one each. You
increase the number of spell gems the apparatus can store by 5.</p>
<p>Multitasking Miracle: The apparatus can now grant the abilities of
three incorporated items simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Armor Prototype (Ex)</strong></p>
<p>You construct an experimental prototype, a unique item that
represents your research and development into a specific new type of
technology. Your experimental prototype can take one of two forms: an
armor or a weapon. You must choose one of these forms upon taking your
first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it can’t be
changed.</p>
<p>If your experimental prototype is ever destroyed or lost, you retain
its schematics in your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for
free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. This
free version is of an item level no greater than your mechanic level – 2
(minimum 1st level). You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24
hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of
conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to
rebuild your experimental prototype. In addition, every time you gain a
mechanic level, you can rebuild your experimental prototype with the
same amount of work, allowing you to change the type of armor or weapon
you chose as a basis for your experimental prototype (selecting an item
of the same type with an item level no higher than the item level of
your previous prototype).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental Armor Prototype</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have designed and built a sophisticated suit of armor, which you
are constantly optimizing and upgrading with the latest technological
breakthroughs. You begin play with one suit of armor with an item level
of 1 for free, or you can buy any armor normally and designate it as
your armor prototype. You design and build this armor and, while it may
be similar in aesthetics and function to an existing type of armor, it
is fundamentally unique from any mass-produced product. Due to its
experimental design and custom fitting, you are the only one who can
benefit from wearing this armor. As you gain levels, your armor
prototype advances in sophistication. If you acquire a different suit of
armor, you can disassemble your existing prototype and turn the new
armor into your prototype with 8 hours of work.</p>
<p>Your armor prototype works as normal for a suit of its type, but it
also gains specific benefits based on your mechanic level, as defined
below. You can have only one suit of armor designated as your armor
prototype at a time.</p>
<p><strong>1 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Armor Prototype Proficiency (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain proficiency in heavy armor. Your armor prototype’s hardness,
HP, and save bonuses are calculated as if its item level were 5
higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calibrate Defenses (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While wearing your experimental armor prototype, you can bolster your
defenses against certain attacks. As a move action, you analyze the
weapons and attack patterns of one enemy you can see, programming your
armor prototype with this information to improve your ability to defend
against that enemy. You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC against the next
attack from that opponent, as long as it occurs before the end of your
next turn. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and to +3 at 16th
level. Calibrating your defenses against another enemy causes you to
immediately lose this bonus against the previous enemy’s attacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extra Upgrade (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your armor prototype’s efficient design allows you to install one
additional armor upgrade beyond what that armor’s upgrade slots would
normally allow. You must purchase the upgrade to be installed in this
slot at its normal price.</p>
<p><strong>5 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power Boost (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain proficiency in powered armor. You can alter your
experimental armor prototype to be identical to any suit of powered
armor that has an item level equal to or lower than your existing armor
prototype by spending 8 hours of work making upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>7 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Customization (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You apply a single armor upgrade with an item level of no more than
half your mechanic level to your experimental armor prototype at no
cost. This customization does not take up an armor upgrade slot. You
select an additional upgrade at 11th, 14th, and 17th levels. Each time
you gain a level, you can swap out any of these armor upgrades for
different upgrades, subject to the same restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>10 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versatile Design (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long hours of research and tinkering has taught you how to modify
your experimental armor prototype on the fly. Your armor prototype
grants you one of the following benefits: +1 to attack rolls, a fly
speed of 50 feet (average maneuverability), a fly speed of 30 feet
(perfect maneuverability), a swim speed of 30 feet, or darkvision with a
range of 60 feet and low-light vision. With 10 minutes of work, you can
change the ability granted by your prototype to any other one of these
abilities.</p>
<p><strong>15 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Energy Shield (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your experimental armor prototype gains an energy shield with a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. This shield
remains active until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted. These
temporary Hit Points are fully restored when you regain Stamina Points
following a 10-minute rest.</p>
<p><strong>20 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defense Matrix (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You perfect your experimental armor prototype’s adaptable defenses,
bolstering your armor against a greater number of enemies. You can use
your calibrate defenses ability to gain a bonus to your AC against a
number of targets equal to your Intelligence modifier, spending a move
action for each calibration.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Explosives (Ex)</strong></p>
<p>You’re an expert at improvising explosives, the components for which
you carry in a special pack, case, or weapons belt that weighs 1 bulk.
Each day when you recover any spent Resolve Points, you can spend 10
minutes using your custom rig to create a number of experimental
grenades and explosive charges (pages 68–69) equal to 1 + your
Intelligence modifier. You create these explosives at no cost, and you
don’t need to decide which specific grenades or explosives you have
until you use them, but when you do, each must have an item level equal
to or less than your mechanic level. Any experimental explosives you
don’t use that day become inert, even if they’re still in your
possession. Your experimental explosives don’t work for anyone but you.
Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can
also prepare one additional experimental explosive, up to the maximum
number of experimental explosives you can have. In addition, your custom
rig functions as a detonator (Core Rulebook 218), and when calculating
the DC of the save to resist your grenade’s effects, you can use your
Intelligence modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p>At 5th level, you add 1/2 your mechanic level, rounded down, to your
damage with grenades; when you explode grenades using the arm explosives
task and a detonator, add this bonus damage only once. Also, your
experimental explosives are magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.</p>
<p>At 7th level, when you use Engineering to perform the arm explosives
or demolitions tasks, you can do so in half the normal time. You can
still use the quick demolitions option (page 69) to further reduce the
time expended. When making an attack with a grenade, you can draw that
grenade as part of the action of making a thrown attack with it.</p>
<p>At 10th level, you can spend 2 Resolve Points as a move action to
assemble an experimental grenade or explosive charge. This grenade or
explosive can have an item level no higher than your mechanic level, and
it counts against the maximum number of experimental explosives you can
have. At 15th level, you can use this ability as a swift action or
reduce its Resolve Point cost to 1. At 11th level, when you use
Engineering for demolitions tasks, each secondary charge you apply adds
+3 to your Engineering check, instead of +2. You increase the range of
your thrown grenades by 10 feet.</p>
<p>At 20th level, you increase the maximum result of your explosive
charges by an amount equal to twice your Intelligence modifier, and each
secondary charge you apply when using the demolitions task adds +4 to
your Engineering check, instead of +2. When you make a full attack, you
can make up to three attacks, so long as at least one of those attacks
is used to throw or launch a grenade. You take a –6 penalty to these
attacks, instead of a –4 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Vehicle (Ex)</strong></p>
<p>You’ve built a unique vehicle of your own design, using the custom
vehicle rules to create your vehicle for free with an item level of 1.
The vehicle must have the experimental graft (page 78), the Medium or
Large size graft, and one of the following type grafts: boat, cruiser,
cycle, submersible, truck, or walker. You can select only from the
following special grafts: amphibious, computer-assisted controls, junk,
luxury, racer, or transport. At 7th level, you can select any type
grafts or special grafts when designing your vehicle, and at 10th level,
your vehicle can have the Huge size graft. Due to the vehicle’s
experimental design, its Piloting modifier decreases by 4 for anyone
other than you who pilots it.</p>
<p>If your experimental vehicle is ever destroyed or lost, you retain
its schematics in your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for
free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. You can
take a single 8-hour rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any
interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add
12 hours to the time required to rebuild your vehicle. In addition,
every time you gain a mechanic level, you can redesign and rebuild your
vehicle with the same amount of work, though if the new design’s price
is higher, you must expend credits equal to the difference between their
prices. Your vehicle’s item level can’t exceed your mechanic level, and
you can have only one experimental vehicle at a time.</p>
<p>As a full action while adjacent to your unoccupied vehicle, you can
cause it to fold into a more compact form through a combination of
null-space technology and cunning joints. This reduces the vehicle’s
size by one category. While miniaturized, the vehicle has a ground speed
of 30 feet, and while its statistics are otherwise unchanged, its
additional systems cease functioning, and it can’t be used as a vehicle.
The miniaturized vehicle follows you automatically, though as a move
action, you can command it to remain in place or resume following you.
As a full action while adjacent to your vehicle, you can restore it to
its normal size and functions and board it. Treat a Large experimental
vehicle’s bulk as 128, and for every size category your vehicle grows or
shrinks, respectively multiply or divide its bulk by 8. If the vehicle’s
bulk is reduced to less than 1, treat it as light bulk. At 11th level,
you can reduce your vehicle’s size by two size categories when
miniaturizing it, and you can activate or revert the miniaturization
while within 30 feet of the vehicle (though you can only automatically
board it if you’re adjacent to the vehicle). At 17th level, you can
reduce your vehicle’s size by three size categories when miniaturizing
it.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Weapon Prototype (Ex)</strong></p>
<p>You construct an experimental prototype, a unique item that
represents your research and development into a specific new type of
technology. Your experimental prototype can take one of two forms: an
armor or a weapon. You must choose one of these forms upon taking your
first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it can’t be
changed.</p>
<p>If your experimental prototype is ever destroyed or lost, you retain
its schematics in your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for
free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. This
free version is of an item level no greater than your mechanic level – 2
(minimum 1st level). You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24
hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of
conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to
rebuild your experimental prototype. In addition, every time you gain a
mechanic level, you can rebuild your experimental prototype with the
same amount of work, allowing you to change the type of armor or weapon
you chose as a basis for your experimental prototype (selecting an item
of the same type with an item level no higher than the item level of
your previous prototype).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental Weapon Prototype</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have designed and built, and are constantly upgrading, a
sophisticated weapon. You begin play with one weapon with an item level
of 1 for free, or you can buy any weapon normally and designated it as
your weapon prototype. You design and build this weapon and, while it
may be similar in aesthetics and function to an existing type of weapon,
it is fundamentally unique from any mass-produced product. Due to its
experimental design and custom safety features, you are the only one who
can make attacks with this weapon. As you gain levels, your weapon
prototype advances in sophistication. If you acquire a different weapon,
you can disassemble your existing prototype and turn the new weapon into
your prototype with 8 hours of work.</p>
<p>Your weapon prototype works as normal for a weapon of its type, but
it gains specific benefits based on your mechanic level, as defined
below. You can have only one weapon designated as your weapon prototype
at a time.</p>
<p><strong>1 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weapon Prototype Proficiency (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain proficiency in advanced melee weapons, heavy weapons, or
longarms. Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed. Your weapon
prototype must be a weapon of this type. Your designated weapon
prototype calculates its hardness, HP, and saves as if its item level
were 5 higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Superior Firepower (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you attack with your experimental weapon prototype, you can
enhance its damage dealt to select foes. As a move action, you calibrate
your weapon prototype to deal additional damage to one enemy you can
see. You gain an insight bonus equal to your mechanic level to damage on
all attacks against the designated target. Calibrating your weapon
against another enemy causes you to immediately lose this bonus against
the previous enemy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improved Magazine (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your experimental weapon prototype can carry more ammunition than a
normal weapon of its type. If it contains individual darts, petrol,
rounds, shells, or similar physical ammunition, its capacity is doubled.
If it uses batteries, it can hold two batteries of the normal size for
that weapon, drawing charges from either.</p>
<p><strong>5 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enhanced Prototype Proficiency (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use your prototype weapon with one hand without penalty, even
if it is normally a two-handed weapon.</p>
<p><strong>7 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Customization (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can apply one of the following weapon special properties to your
experimental weapon prototype. You can apply only special properties
that are applicable to the weapon you’re using, so you couldn’t (for
example) add quick reload to a weapon that doesn’t use charges or
ammunition. The GM is the final arbiter of what can be applied to any
weapon. Choose from: aurora, block, breach, breakdown, bright, disarm,
echo, extinguish, feint, injection, harrying, penetrating, quick reload,
recall, stun, trip.</p>
<p>At 11th level, you can add a second weapon special property from that
list, or you can add force as a second weapon special property.
Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a
critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition
to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6,
+1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, bleed (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels),
corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, knockdown. You may add
this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a
critical hit both effects apply. A weapon cannot have two versions of
the same critical hit effect.</p>
<p>At 17th level, you can instead add the blind, demoralize, wound,
sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon
property or a critical hit effect.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can switch any of these
customizations for a different customization, but you must always choose
at least one customization from the 7th-level list.</p>
<p><strong>10 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versatile Design (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long hours of research and tinkering have taught you how to modify
your weapon prototype on the fly. Select four weapon fusions of a level
your prototype weapon qualifies for. Your weapon gains one of these
fusions without it counting against the total item levels of fusions it
can have. With 1 minute of work, you can change the weapon fusion
currently installed in your weapon prototype to another of your selected
fusions. If a fusion selected with this ability has a limited number of
uses, using it counts against the uses of any other fusion you access
with this ability. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can change
the four fusions you have selected.</p>
<p><strong>15 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dual Chambers (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You modify your experimental weapon prototype to deal multiple types
of damage. Select one additional type of weapon damage that your weapon
does not normally deal. When you attack with your experimental weapon
prototype, you can deal either type of damage or both. Switching between
damage types, or switching your weapon to deal both, is a move action.
Each time you gain a level, you can switch your secondary damage type,
but you can’t change the weapon’s original damage type without crafting
a new experimental weapon prototype.</p>
<p><strong>20 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Target-Rich Environment (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You enhance your experimental weapon prototype’s attack power,
allowing you to deal extra damage to multiple enemies. You can use your
superior firepower ability to deal additional damage to a number of
targets equal to your Intelligence modifier, taking a move action to
calibrate it against each foe.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic Improvements</strong></p>
<p>This mechanic alternate class feature can be taken only by characters
who can be targeted by affects that only affect constructs, including
those of the construct type and those with the constructed species trait
(such as androids). You’re constantly tinkering with your robotic
components, adding, adjusting, and removing them as suits your
wishes.</p>
<p>At 1st level, you add equipment to your robotic body that performs a
specialized function. You gain 1 drone mod, which applies to you rather
than to a drone. You must meet any prerequisite the drone mod has,
though you’re automatically considered to have manipulator arms. You
select one kind of drone chassis and count as that chassis for purposes
of meeting mod prerequisites, though you gain none of that drone
chassis’s other abilities. You aren’t considered to automatically have a
melee weapon arm or weapon mount, though you can select those as mods to
add to yourself. There’s no cost for this bonus drone mod, but if you
get a mod that can use other equipment that must be bought separately if
added to a drone (such as needing to buy weapons separately if you give
a drone a weapon mount), you must still pay for that additional
equipment normally.</p>
<p>You can’t select any drone mod that affects your AC (such as extra
armor), saving throws (such as hardened AI), and class skills or skill
ranks (such as skill subroutine), nor any that grants you temporary Hit
Points (such as energy shield) or allows the drone to take actions when
you’re unconscious (such as medical subroutine). You also can’t select
mods that result in a drone shutting itself down (such as shock waves)
or causes it to share a space with its mechanic.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in the place of a drone mod, you can install a
specialized piece of internal equipment that gives you a bonus feat.
This feat must be one a drone can select as a feat, and you must meet
its prerequisites. If you have a trick that expands what feats a drone
of yours could take (such as exploration routine; see page 18 of
Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual), you can select from that expanded
list as well.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can swap out one robotic
improvement, removing a previous selection and making a new choice. You
can’t remove a robotic improvement that gives you a feat that’s a
prerequisite for any option you’ve taken.</p>
<p>You gain an additional robotic improvement at 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th,
and 20th level.</p>
