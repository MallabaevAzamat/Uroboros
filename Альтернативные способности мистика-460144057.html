<p><strong>Epiphanies</strong></p>
<p>While most mystics receive powers closely aligned to their
connection, a few receive glimpses of supernatural insight that allows
them to access different powers. Among mystic scholars, such an insight
is generally known as an epiphany.</p>
<p>If an epiphany allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is
equal to 10 + half your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier. If the
epiphany requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to
10 + 1-1/2 × your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Когда вы получаете новую дарованную силу, вы можете заменить её
epiphany того же или более низкого уровня.</p>
<p><strong>1 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empowered Healing Touch (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use your healing touch class feature as a standard action.
You can also use healing touch more often by spending 1 Resolve Point
each time you use healing touch after the first use each day. You must
have the healing touch class feature to learn this epiphany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limning Spell (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you cast a mystic spell, you can cause one creature affected by
the spell to glow for 1 round, shedding normal light in a 10-foot
radius. This doesn’t negate a creature’s concealment (if any), but as
long as the target isn’t in bright light, creatures become aware of the
target’s location. The creature can negate this epiphany’s effect with a
successful Will save.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mystic Flare (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your studies, you have benefited from a solarian tutor, who taught
you how to draw power from the foundational forces of the universe. For
you, a star’s corona or a black hole’s event horizon is a source of
infinite energy. You gain a solar flare, as the solar manifestation
ability of a solarian with a class level equal to your mystic level. If
you have levels in both classes, you add them together to determine the
effectiveness of your solar flare. You do not gain any other solar-flare
solarian abilities from mystic class levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overbearing Stare (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each day when you regain Stamina Points and daily-use abilities
following an 8-hour rest, choose one of the following: AC, attack rolls,
Fortitude saves, Reflex saves, or Will saves. You can focus your gaze on
one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, bringing down upon it the
full might of unseen spirits associated with your connection. The target
must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 penalty to the chosen
statistic. You can maintain this effect against only one opponent at a
time, and it remains in effect until you stare at a new target, the
opponent moves more than 30 feet away from you, or either you or the
opponent fall unconscious or dies. The penalties of multiple overbearing
stares don’t stack. Once you have used this ability against a target,
you can’t do so again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting,
sense-dependent curse effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solar Connection (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have forged a connection to the powers of the cosmos, drawing
upon a link to photons and gravity to forge a weapon made from the
primal stuff of the universe. You gain a solar weapon, as the solar
manifestation ability of a solarian with a class level equal to your
mystic level. If you have levels in both classes, you add them together
to determine the effectiveness of your solar weapon. You do not gain any
other solar-weapon focused solarian abilities from mystic class
levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Triune’s Bypass (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ve learned to use computers almost intuitively, letting your
faith guide you without much need for technical understanding. You can
attempt Computers checks to detect fake shells, disable or manipulate
modules, gain root access, and hack systems untrained, and you can add
your Wisdom modifier to such checks instead of your Intelligence
modifier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wrecking Fists (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, and your unarmed
strikes don’t count as archaic weapons. Whenever you attack an opponent
with your unarmed strikes as a standard action (or a full attack as a
full action), as part of that action you can expend a 1st-level or
higher spell slot before attempting the first attack roll to deal
additional damage. If that attack hits, you deal an additional 2d6
damage per level of the spell slot expended, of the same damage type as
your unarmed strike.</p>
<p><strong>3 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expanded Skill Channeling (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose two skills other than your connection’s associated skills. You
add the insight bonus granted by the channel skill class feature to
skill checks attempted with the chosen skills. In addition, you add your
connection’s associated skills and any skills chosen with this epiphany
to your list of class skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Influence Tech (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can affect constructs, robots, and other creatures that have the
technological subtype with your mind-affecting spells, even if they’re
mindless or normally immune to such effects. However, they receive a +2
bonus to their Will saves against your mind-affecting spells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondary Connection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose a second connection. If you worship a deity, your second
connection must be one associated with that deity. You gain the
1st-level connection power from the chosen connection. You don’t gain
any additional connection powers from that connection, nor do you gain
an insight bonus to skill checks attempted with the second connection’s
associated skills from your channel skill ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spell Transference (Sp)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to transfer a
condition or spell affecting one willing target to another willing
target, both of whom you’re touching. At 12th level, you can transfer
effects between creatures affected by your telepathic bond class feature
without touching them.</p>
<p><strong>6 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improved Secondary Connection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain the 3rd-level connection power from your secondary
connection. You must have the secondary connection epiphany to choose
this epiphany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mystic Reach (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can alter a mystic spell’s range by casting it as a full action
instead of its normal casting time. Touch spells become close-range
spells (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels), close-range spells become medium-range
spells (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), medium-range spells become long-range
spells (400 ft. + 40 ft./level), and long-range spells have their range
doubled. You can’t use this ability to alter a mystic spell with a
casting time of a full action or longer. You can use this ability once
per day at no cost, but you must spend 1 Resolve Point each time you use
it after the first in a single day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel Processing (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once per day, by spending a Resolve Point, you can cut in half the
time it takes to use Computers to hack a system without an increase to
the DC of the check (to a minimum of one full action); you can still
also voluntarily increase the DC by 5 to halve the time once again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repairing Touch (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically repair an object,
restoring up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level. You add mending and make
whole to your list of spells known. You can’t swap these spells out to
learn new spells in their place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wrecking Spells (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage, you can
increase the spell’s damage by an amount equal to half your mystic
level. This increased damage applies to all creatures damaged by an area
spell, but for spells that target multiple creatures with multiple rays
or other attacks, the increased damage applies only to a single ray or
missile. This increased damage doesn’t apply to ongoing damage from the
spell (such as bleed or burn damage). This epiphany doesn’t increase
ability damage or other spell effects, only damage to Stamina Points or
Hit Points.</p>
<p><strong>9 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farsight (Sp)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain a divination reservoir. Each day when you regain your mystic
spells, your divination reservoir fills with a number of points equal to
half your mystic level. Any points from the previous day are lost. You
can cast clairaudience/clairvoyance as a spell-like ability by spending
1 point from your divination reservoir, or arcane eye by spending 2
points from your divination reservoir. By spending 4 points from your
arcane reservoir, you can combine these effects, allowing you to create
an invisible magical sensor (as arcane eye) at any location you’re
familiar with at a planetary range.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memory Storage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can cast displace memory as a spell-like ability once per day.
Additionally, by spending a Resolve Point when casting this spell, you
can transport the target object into an extraplanar warehouse for up to
24 hours. You can recall the object into your hands by concentrating on
the object as a full action. If you don’t retrieve the object within 24
hours, it’s destroyed, but you can transport it back into the warehouse
after retrieving it by spending an additional Resolve Point. At each of
12th, 15th, and 18th level, you can use this ability an additional time
per day; there’s no limit to how many objects you can have within the
extraplanar warehouse at any given time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mind Probe (Sp)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can cast mind probe as a spell-like ability a number of times per
day equal to your mystic level. Once a creature succeeds at its saving
throw against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this
ability for 24 hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mystic Step (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You naturally hover 6 inches above liquid or solid surfaces unless
you will it otherwise. You don’t leave tracks and are immune to the
off-kilter condition. You fall at a rate of 60 feet per round and take
no damage upon landing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spell Bond (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you cast a harmless spell with a range of touch, you can target
any ally within 120 feet and linked by your telepathic bond class
feature as if you were touching that ally. You must have the telepathic
bond class feature to choose this epiphany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tripartite Mind (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by Triune’s threefold form, you create two duplicates of
your consciousness that misdirect and stymie mental intrusion. Any time
you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect that affects you
(rather than affecting an area), the effect has an equal chance of
affecting you or one of your remaining mental duplicates. If the effect
affects a duplicate, you are instead affected as though you had
succeeded at the saving throw, and the duplicate is destroyed. When you
rest and regain your daily spell slots, you recreate any destroyed
mental duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>12 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greater Secondary Connection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You gain the 6th-level connection power from your secondary
connection. You must have the secondary connection epiphany and the
improved secondary connection epiphany to choose this epiphany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lingering Spell (Ex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you cast a spell with a duration of longer than 1 round, you can
spend 1 Resolve Point to double its duration. If the spell is one of
your connection spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer,
its duration increases to 24 hours instead. You can have only one spell
affected by this epiphany at a time, and using this ability while
another spell is already in effect causes that previous spell to
immediately end as if its duration had expired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindlink Bond (Su)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can combine your mindlink and telepathic bond class features,
allowing you to rapidly transfer memories between bonded creatures at
great distances. Once per round, any creature belonging to a telepathic
bond that you created with your telepathic bond class feature can
instantly transfer complex information to any other creatures within the
telepathic bond, as the mindlink spell, as a swift action. Each time
this ability is used, the creature chooses which creatures belonging to
your telepathic bond receive this information.</p>
<p>You must have the mindlink and telepathic bond class features to
choose this epiphany.</p>
<p><strong>15 уровень</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guided Reincarnation (Sp)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once per day, you can cast reincarnate as a spell-like ability by
spending all your remaining Resolve Points (minimum one-quarter your
total Resolve Points). Instead of rolling to determine what type of
creature the target returns as, the target returns as the race, gender,
sex, and physical appearance of their choice. Rather than be a conscious
choice of the target, this decision tends to reflect the innermost
dreams and desires of the target’s soul, and so the reincarnation can be
either identical to their previous form or a drastic departure,
depending upon the individual.</p>
<p>Unlike the spell reincarnate, this ability does not require a
monument as part of the casting. Instead, both you and your target gain
2 permanent negative levels (as described by the spell). The target
returns to life as an infant of their race, growing from infancy to
young adulthood over the course of 1 hour. The target has memories of
their original life, but also of a new life that could have existed if
they had lived in their new form. In addition to having a new race, the
character can be rewritten as if they had used a mnemonic editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify Memory (Sp)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use modify memory as a spell-like ability a number of times
per day equal to your mystic level. Once a creature successfully saves
against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability
for 24 hours. When a target fails its saving throw against this spell,
you can spend up to 3 Resolve Points. If you spend 1 Resolve Point, all
changes you make to the target’s memory are instantaneous and require no
additional rounds of concentration. If you spend 2 Resolve Points, you
can change up to 1 hour of memories per mystic level you have. If you
spend 3 Resolve Points, you can change up to 1 day of memories per
mystic level you have.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic Smith (Su)</strong></p>
<p>When crafting hybrid or magic items, the number of ranks you have in
Engineering and Mysticism is treated as one higher for the purposes of
determining what items you can craft and how long it takes to craft
them. The time it takes you to install, remove, or transfer a fusion
seal is reduced by a number of rounds equal to your mystic level, to a
minimum of 1 round. When you transfer a fusion seal to a weapon, the
fusion seal begins functioning after 1 round (or immediately if you also
spend 1 Resolve Point).When crafting hybrid or magic items, the number
of ranks you have in Engineering and Mysticism is treated as one higher
for the purposes of determining what items you can craft and how long it
takes to craft them. The time it takes you to install, remove, or
transfer a fusion seal is reduced by a number of minutes equal to your
mystic level, to a minimum of 1 minute. When you transfer a fusion seal
to a weapon, the fusion seal begins functioning after only 1 hour (or
immediately if you also spend 1 Resolve Point).</p>
<p>You add mending and make whole to your mystic spell list. Once per
day, you can cast make whole as a spell-like ability, using your mystic
level as your caster level, except the spell restores 1d6 Hit Points for
each mystic level you have.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Engineering and
Mysticism skill checks made to craft, identify, and repair hybrid and
magic items. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every three
levels thereafter.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, as a swift action, you can supercharge your magical
gear for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier, during which
time you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with hybrid weapons. This
bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 18th level. Once you use
this ability, you can't do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to
recover Stamina Points.</p>
<p>At 11th level, you can touch a weapon fusion or fusion seal installed
in a weapon (requiring a successful melee attack against an unwilling
wielder's EAC) as a standard action to drain that fusion, rendering it
nonfunctional for 1 hour; the fusion can't be uninstalled or transferred
while drained, and it still counts toward the total levels of fusions
the weapon can have. You simultaneously grant the fusion's benefit to up
to 10 weapons within 30 feet of you; this fusion doesn't count against
the total levels of fusions those weapons can have but otherwise follows
the rules for weapon fusions. After draining a fusion, you can't drain
that same fusion for 24 hours.</p>
